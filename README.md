GETWatchBot
===========

A bot for [@GETWatch](http://twitter.com/GETWatch), by Kabo-chan.

The **old and busted** GETWatchBot. I have reuploaded it for reference. The newer GETWatchBot2 can be found [here](https://github.com/feblehober123/GETWatchBot2) ~~will automatically tweet about upcoming GETs 45 minutes before they happen. This will cut out a lot of work for the humans, because they should no longer have to manually check when GETs are occuring and tweet about them.
However, if a human has tweeted about the GET, the bot will not post and defer to the human since humans are more social than bots. It will also tweet about new boards.~~
